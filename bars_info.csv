Holiday Cocktail Lounge,1,https://infatuation.imgix.net/media/images/guides/the-manhattan-bar-directory/Holiday%20Cocktail%20Lounge.jpg?auto=format&blur=100&q=0&w=256,http://www.holidaycocktaillounge.nyc,75 Saint Marks Pl,[],"Holiday Cocktail Lounge has been around for a very long time, and presently it's something between a cocktail lounge and a dive bar. It works perfectly for the area. When you’re drinking on St. Mark’s, you want your bar to be a little grungy. This place is dark, it has throw-back vibes, they serve a small menu of pretty-good bar food, and the cocktails are great. Plan your next low-key birthday here.",1
The Immigrant,1,https://infatuation.imgix.net/media/images/guides/the-manhattan-bar-directory/The%20Immigrant.jpg?auto=format&blur=100&q=0&w=256,http://theimmigrantnyc.com,341 E 9th St,"[('Saturday', '5pm-3am'), ('Sunday', '5pm-1am'), ('Monday', '5pm-1am'), ('Tuesday', '5pm-1am'), ('Wednesday', '5pm-1am'), ('Thursday', '5pm-1am'), ('Friday', '5pm-3am'), ('Saturday', '5pm-3am'), ('Sunday', '5pm-1am'), ('Monday', '5pm-1am'), ('Tuesday', '5pm-1am'), ('Wednesday', '5pm-1am'), ('Thursday', '5pm-1am'), ('Friday', '5pm-3am')]","The Immigrant is a very normal bar in the East Village that has one abnormal thing about it: it’s divided in two. On one side they serve beer, and in the space next door they serve wine. It’s an interesting concept, and it’s a nice place to have a casual drink with friends.",1
Boilermaker,1,https://infatuation.imgix.net/media/images/guides/the-manhattan-bar-directory/Boilermaker.jpg?auto=format&blur=100&q=0&w=256,http://www.boilermakernyc.com/#home,13 1st Ave,"[('Saturday', '4pm-4am'), ('Sunday', '4pm-2am'), ('Monday', '5pm-2am'), ('Tuesday', '5pm-2am'), ('Wednesday', '5pm-2am'), ('Thursday', '5pm-4am'), ('Friday', '5pm-4am'), ('Saturday', '4pm-4am'), ('Sunday', '4pm-2am'), ('Monday', '5pm-2am'), ('Tuesday', '5pm-2am'), ('Wednesday', '5pm-2am'), ('Thursday', '5pm-4am'), ('Friday', '5pm-4am')]","Boilermaker is a casual cocktail bar on Houston with lots of seating and some above-average bar food. If you’re into veggie burgers, you should know they make a decent one. And if you stick around until midnight, that’s when they start serving pancakes (every night of the week). They also make some great cocktails and pour a good selection of craft beers. So the next time you need a low-key drink (and maybe some food) in the East Village, check this place out.",1
Death & Co,3,https://infatuation.imgix.net/media/CACHE/images/reviews/death-co/banners/Death-Co_1/33c020c438c915a16822e6f9ac191dc3.jpg?auto=format&blur=100&q=0&w=256,http://www.deathandcompany.com/,433 E. 6th St.,"[('Saturday', '6pm-3am'), ('Sunday', '6pm-2am'), ('Monday', '6pm-2am'), ('Tuesday', '6pm-2am'), ('Wednesday', '6pm-2am'), ('Thursday', '6pm-2am'), ('Friday', '6pm-3am'), ('Saturday', '6pm-3am'), ('Sunday', '6pm-2am'), ('Monday', '6pm-2am'), ('Tuesday', '6pm-2am'), ('Wednesday', '6pm-2am'), ('Thursday', '6pm-2am'), ('Friday', '6pm-3am')]","You know how it feels like some establishments were built precisely for you? That’s how we feel about Death & Co. Any place that makes room on their menu to quote Hunter S. Thompson - “I hate to advocate drugs, alcohol, violence, or insanity, but they’ve always worked for me.” - is on our wavelength. It’s no secret that we like to booze. When it comes to fancy cocktails, Death & Co is one of our favorites. The drink list is ridiculous...it’s nearly impossible to settle on something because each beverage is intriguing and awesome. Some of our favorites are the Cure For Pain (rye whiskey, vermouth, bourbon, and more goodness) and the seriously tasty Rita Hayworth (pineapple and sage-infused siembra tequila, lime juice, and acacia honey syrup). Damn is she fine.
It wasn’t until recently that we figured out D&C was more than just a place to grab a libation or two. You can actually have an excellent meal as well. Think of it as a tapas joint that resembles a wedding cocktail hour: American classics that go quite well with a drink shaken or stirred. The kitchen paces itself well, so dishes come out one at a time, and they give you a chance to enjoy your drink as well as the food. After a long day, a Robert Johnson Swizzle (single barrel bourbon, lime juice, 10yr port, vanilla syrup and more) with a side of truffle mac n cheese is exactly what the doctor ordered.",1

Instead, it’s a cozy, casual spot for a low-key drink.",1

Because on weekdays after work, it’s the go-to for young professionals who work in Noho. Plan your next Happy Hour outing accordingly. (But also know that this place can be a total sh*tshow on weekends.)",2

Up front there’s a bar, and in the back there are games like skee ball and pool. There are booths in both spaces, but on busy nights you’ll find most people milling around. On weekends, Ace Bar gets crowded, but you can usually carve yourself out some space. Consider this an LES bar in the East Village.",1

They make great cocktails, but they aren’t uptight like those bars where you have to enter a phone booth then name all fifty presidents in order to get seated. It’s a good, cozy, always-lively spot to get a drink in Alphabet City. They also do a small menu (with brunch on weekends), and there’s live music on certain days.",1
